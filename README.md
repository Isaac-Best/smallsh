# smallsh

Important Note: There are two `smallsh` implementations in this parent directory. The first `smallsh.c` is my initial submission for the assignment. The second implementation is a modularized version that I'm currently working on to enhance the organization and maintainability of the code.

Please note that the modularized version is still a work in progress and not yet a complete representation of the final code. (It does run and pass the provided testscript 100%)

There will be an associated tutorial / blog post for this when I'm done editing. [HERE](https://nextjs-blog-6upu.vercel.app/)

What I want to implement:
* I'd like to run a lint / formatter check on the code 
* consitency in the conditionals curly braces ex get rid of the one line if's with no brackets for clarity 
* clean up the .h and .c separation
